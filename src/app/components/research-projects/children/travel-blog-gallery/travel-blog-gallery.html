            <h5>Goal:</h5>
            <p class="page-text">
              The idea was to create a travel blog where the main focus is on photographs

            <h5>Reason:</h5>
            <p class="page-text">
              Often I see some kind of cool sites and there is a desire to make something similar. This is
              one of them.

            <h5>A moment of sadness:</h5>
            <p class="page-text">
              Unfortunately, I canâ€™t remember what kind of site it was and it is even more sad that the
              project sources were lost. But the video was saved how several versions of the project
              worked

        <h5>Firs version:</h5>
        <div class="row mb-5">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>The first version had in my opinion <strong class="text-primary">not very convenient
                navigation</strong>, because not allowed to
              move between images except flipping one at a time. </p>
            <p>There were also <strong class="text-primary">no previews</strong> that would allow you to see
              the rest of the images, but do not
              switch to them</p>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>The second version has <strong class="text-primary">more convenient navigation</strong>,
              and allows you to <strong class="text-primary">preview other images</strong> </p>
            <p>I also added some <strong class="text-primary">navigation animations</strong> and <strong
                      class="text-primary">play/pause button</strong> that will flip images on its own</p>
